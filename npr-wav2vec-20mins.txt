SUPPORT FOR IN PR IN THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE COME FROM SUPERMACRO ENENVITIA EX CELERATING A  AT SCAL WITH A WIDE RANGE F A I SERVERS AND THE N VD A I INTERPRISE SOFT WER PLATFORM SUPERMARRO PIOMERS ESTAMABLE RAK SCALE INNOVATIONS TO DRIVE A I INFERSTRUCTURE BREAK THROUGS HAY THERE IT'S THE EMPIAR POLITICS PO CASS UMS SUSAN GAVE US I COVER POLITICS AND TO DAY ON THE POD WERE TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT COULD BE ONE OF THE MOST DECISIVE GROUPS OF VOTERS IN THIS YEARS ELECTION VOTERS WHO JISAPPROVE OF BOTH JO BIDEN AN DONALD TRUMP IT'S A PROJECT MARLISON AND I ARE WORKING ON AND WE ACTUALLY RECORDED A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT ON THURSDAY JUST BEFORE NEWS OF THE TRUMP VERDIC BROKE SO JUST HAVE THAT MINE WHEN YOU LISTEN IT'S MARMY AND DEEPAS CHIVERUM IN THE HOST CHAIR SO WITHOUT FURTHER DO HERE'S DEEPA SO I MEAN WHY WERE WE TALKING ABOUT THESE VOTERS SPECIFICALLY WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE HOW DO THEY FITT INTO THE ROTER ELECTRIT I MEAN THIS IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT IF YOU BEEN FOLLOWING THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT A LOT THERE OFTEN RE FERRED TO HIS DOUBLE HATERS I'M TRYING NOT TO USE THAT TERM BECAUSE I HEAR MY MOMVOY SAYING TO MY KIDS WE DON'T USE THE WARD HATE IN THIS HOUSE SOL DIS APPROVERATES IS AT IS A STRONG WORA ANDIGO IT'S ELSO JUST NOT REALLY ACCURATE SO RICH TAL IS A BIT OF A FOCUS GROUP GOORU HE CAN DUCTS FOCUS GROUPS WIT SWING VOTERS ALL OVER THE CONTRY FOR DIFFERENT NEWS ORGANIZATIONS AND WE ASKED HIM TO DO ONE FOR ENPIAR AND RICH ASK THESE VOTERS TO GIVE A DESCRIPTION OF BOTH BIDONAN TRUMP AND YOU GET A SENSE THAT THE FEELINGS TOWARD BIDON ARE LESS VICERAL THAN THEY ARE TOWARDS TRUMP SO IT'S TA WE PRESIDENT BI SO THE FIRST WORD OF PHRASIT COMES TO MINE WHEN YOU HEAR PRESIDENT BI STANLI IT SUN AH SENA IGA O LON THAY E A RUM OLD NEXT PERSON FIRST THING IT COMES TO MINE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP ID CAAS AH AH SARLIN TAT NATION THE CIA A FANSON AT MER I ESA RI RAH ONSENSER YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THEY TALK ABOUT BIDON AND THE WAY THEY TOK ABOUT TRUMP THE ADJECTIVES ARE MUCH MORE EXTREME ABOUT TRUMP BIDON IS A DODDERING OLD GUY YA SO THEYRE MORE DISAPPOINTED IN HIM BUT THE'RE OFFENDED BY TRUMP SO MARA I MEAN WHEN YOU AS WERE GETTING INTO THIS STORY YOU DECIDED TO PARTNER WITH RICH TOW OF EN GAGE US AND SAYGO WHICH IS A MARKET RESEARCH FIRM AND YOU GESS HOW TO ABOUT A DOZEN OF THESE DOUBLE DISAPPROVERS IN KEYS WING STATES I MEAN WHAT ERE YOU TRY TO LEARN FROM THESE PEOPLE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO LEARN FROM THESE PEOPLE IS WHAT THEY MIGHT DO ON ELECTION DAY THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE EITHEIR CANDIDATE THE QUESTIONS WE HAD WERE WHERE THEY GAN TO HOLD THEIR NOSE AND VOTE FOR BIDON WHERE THEY GAN TA HOLD THEIR NOSE AND VOTE FOR TRUMP AH WOULD THEY VOTE FOR S THEIR PARTY CANDIDATE OR WOULD THEY JUST STAY HOME AND IN MANY CASES THE COMPETITION HERE IS NOT ANOTHER CANDIDATE IT'S THE COUCH AND TO BE CLEAR WHEN YOU GETS HAD THIS CONVERSATION A DOZEN FOLKS THIS IS NOT A SCIENTIFIC PULL RIGHT I MEAN AND YEAR DOES PULLING WITH MARISAN PE BAS BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT THIS IS LIKE ANECDOTAL DATA YOU'RE CHOTTING WITH THESE FOKS YOU'RE GETTING A PICTURE OF WHAT THESE PEOPLERE THINKING HOW THEY'R FEELING ABOUT THE ELECTION AND THAT'S DIFFERENT THEN POI THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN PULLING BECAUSE IT'S NOT A BIG SAMPLE IT'S JUST TWELVE PEOPLE BUT THE REASON PEOPLE DO FOCUS GROUPS IS TO GET INTO THE MINS AND THE BRAINS OF VOTERS TO GO A LITTLE MORE IN DEPTH THAN JUST T ASKING THEM A QUESTION WHERE THEY CAN ANSWER BIDIN OUR TRUMP PULLS ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION HOW MANY OUR OWN PULLING TELLS US THAT DOUBLE HATERS DOUBLE DISAPPROVERS MAKE UP ABOUT FOURTEEN PER CENT OF THE ELECTRATE AND IN OUR PULLING IT SHOWS THEM NEARLY SPLIT EVENLY BETWEEN JO BIDON AND DONALD TRUMP JO BIDON HAS A SLIGHT ADVANTAGE BUT THESE ARE ALLSO VOTERS IF YOU LOOK HISTORICALLY IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION FOR INSTANCE DOUBLE HATERS EXISTED THEN TWO BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND HILLERY CWLINTON AN IN THAT ELECTION WHEN THEY MADE UP A SIGNIFICAN TRUNK OF THE ELECTRATE THEY BROKE PRETTY STRONGLY TOWARDS DONALD TRUMP SE  GESS HOW TO A A DOZEN PEOPLE LIKE WE SAID WHO WHO ARE THEY WERE TO THEY COME FROM O CASE O WE SPECIFICALLY ASKD RICH TO FIND A SWING VOTERS IN SWING STATES LITERALLY THE DECIDERS OF THIS ELECTION AND AALL TWELVE OF THEM WERE TRUMP TO BIDON VOTERS SO THEY VOTED DONALD TRUMP AN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO JOBIDONAN TWENTY TWENTY AND TEN OF THE TWELVE RESIDE IN WHAT IS CONSIDERED A SWING STATE ONE OF THE SEVEN STATES THAT WAS DECIDED IN TWENTY TWENTY BY THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS OR LESS SO WE HAVEN'T SAS OF HOW THEIR FEELINGABOUT TRUMP HOW THEY'RE FEELING ABOUT BIDEN BUT THES KIND OF SEEM LIKE THEY'RE GING TO VOTE I MAN ARE THEY LEADING ONE WAY ARE THE OTHER AT THIS POINT WHAT WHAT O THAT'S HE LIKE SO IN THESE FOCUS GROUPS WE DID TWO SETS OF SIX AND RICH ASKED EVERY ONE IF THE ELECTION WAS HELD TO DAY IN A BINARY ELECTION WHO WOULD YOU VOTE FOR AND WHEN PUSH SEVEN OF THE TWELVE SAID THEY WOULD LEAN TOWARDS BIDON ONE OF THE BIG COMPLICATING FACTORS AND SOMETHING WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT ON THE POD THIRD PARTIES AYHEN YOU THEN THROW IN THE MIX OF ROBERT AF KENNEDY JUNIOR OR JULL STINE OR CORNEL WEST THAT SUPPORT FOR BID AN DROPS DOWN TO FIVE OF THE TWELVE WHICH I THINK SHOWS THAT THIRD PARTY TICKETS ON THE BALLATS ESPECIALLY I THESE SWING STATES PRESENT A BIGGER RISK TO THE ENCOMENT PRESIDENT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THEIR PARTY CANDIDATE HEMN PEOPLE LIKE ROBERT OF KENNEDY ARE THESE VOTERS FEELING ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THAT IS THAT JUS TEY DON'T LIKE BINER TRUMPS WOF THIES SORT OF WANT TO FALLEN AT THEIR PARTY CANDEDATE THIS IS VERY HARD TO FIGURE OUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FROCUSS GROUP KIND OF WAS SAID ROBER OF KENNEDY COULD BRING US TOGETHER BECAUSE OF HIS FAMILY I MEAN THIRD PARTY IS A PLACE TO LAND WHAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE EITHER CANDEDATE HOW LONG YOU CAN ASTAY THERE AND WHETHER YOU ACTUALLY AND A PULLING THE LEVER FOR THAT PERSON WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET SO IS NOT LIKE THEY HAD A LOF ENTHUSIASM NECESSARILY FOR THE THIRD PARTY CANNEDAY WIS THEY HAVN' DA AS AN FOR NOT VOTING FOR THE OTHER TO  AND AND THIS IS LIKE LOOK A LOT OF VOKUS ROUPS IS VIBES RIHTE SO THOSE TO STALK ABOUT THE VIBES FOR SECOND I MEAN THE VIBES ARE CLEARLY LIKE ALL TWELVE OF THEM SAID IF THEY COULD REPLACE BOTH CANDEDATES ON THE BALLAT THEY WOULD WHICH IS REALLY TELLS YOU THATED SHEYRE JUST THEY DON'T WANT THESE CHOICES THERE'S OBVIOUSLY IT OPEN TO THIRD PARTY KENNEDATES BUT WHEN MAR TALKS ABOUT THE TWO RISKS AS STAY HOME OR VOTE THIRD PARTY IN THIS PARTICULAR GROUP OF PEOPLE AND AND TO BE CLEAR THESE PEOPLE SCUWED A LITTLE BIT OLDER LATE THIRTIES AND TO THEIR FIFTIES CAUSE WE WERE SPECIFICALLY LOOKING FOR PROVIN SWING VOTERS PEOPLE HAD WHO AD VOTED SHE PROBABLY NEEDED A COUPLE ELECTIONS UNDER YOUR ABOUT AND THEY WOULD SKEW A LITTLA BIT OLDER THESE PEOPLE WERE GIN A VOKE TO ME TO ME THE RISK OF THE OLDER DOUBLE HEATER IS THIRD PARTY THE RISK OF THE YOUNGER DOUBLE HETER IT THE LOWER PROPENSITY VOTERS THAT THEY STATAY AT HOME SDOON THECOUNCH O GAK QUOL WERE NA TAKE A QUICKBREAK AND WHEN WE GET BACK WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT THESE DOUBLE DISAPPROVERS CARE ABOUT SUPPORT FOR AND PIARE AND THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE COME FROM BETTERMENT THE OTOMATED INVESTING AND SAVINGS AP SEE O SARA LEVY EXPLAINS HOW BETTER MENS TECHNOLOGY HELPS AND VESTORS BETTER

INFORMATION AND INSPIRATION BECAUSE THE BEST STORIES DON'T TELL YOU WHAT TO THINK THEY'RE MADE TO MAKE YOU THINK GET THE WORLD STORIES ON THE NEW B B C DOT COME O AY AND WERE BACK MY QUESTION IS TO BOTH OF YOU I MEAN THESE VOTERS DON'T LIKE BIDIN OR TRUMP WRIGHT THAT'S WHAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED BUT IS THERE A WA TO GET A BETTER SENSE MAY BE OF HOW THEY'LL MEAN WHEN THEY VOTE B SD ON CERTAIN ISSUES LIKE THE ECONOMY IMMIGRATION THINKS LIKE THAT MAR IMAN LETS TART WITH THE ECONOMY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS OFTEN SEEN IN PULLING AS VOTERS NUMBER ONE CONCERN THIS NOVEMBEROR THIS HEAR BASICALLY WHAT IS YOU HERE FROM THE FOKS IN THESCRUPT THE FOLKS IN THES GROUP WERE VERY MUCH LIKE EVERY OTHER AMERICAN THAT PULSTERS HAVE TALKE TO THIS YEAR WHICH IS THEY THINK THE ECONOMY IS TERRIBLE I'M THEIR OWN PERSONAL SITUATIONS MAY BE A LITTLE BETTER BUT THEY AW LOT OF THEM TALKED ABOUT GOIN O THE GROCERY STORE IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE AND THAT'S WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE RATE OF INFLATION IS IS ABOUT PRICES AND INFLATION DEFEATS PRESIDENTS THIS IS AN ISSUE WHERE I THINK THAT THE THE ARK OF THEA VIBES BEN TOWARD TRUMP BECAUSE THERE IS THE SENSE THAT WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT THE ECONOMY WAS BETTER HONE OF THE VOTERS ALSO BROUGHT THE REALITY THAT LIKE LOOK THERE WIS A PANDEMIC IN THERE LIKE THAT I THINK THEY'RE AWARE THAT THERE WIS LIKE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES THAT JOBINE WAS HANDED BUT PEOPLE DO TEND TO THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP SPECIFICALLY IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY MORE BROADLY I'M CAN DO A BETTER JOB WHEN AT COMES TO THE ECONOMY AND AND LOOK RICH PUT THE QUESTION TO THEM DIRECTLY AN LIKE TO KNOW WHO YOU THINK WOULD DO A BETTER JOB MANAGING THE ECONOMY OVER THE NEXT FOR YEARS TRUMP OR BY WOUL'S TA TRUM FORF YOU WOULD WOUL'S THE BD TO EXPAINE TO ME WHY YOU THINK TROU WOULD DO A BETTER JOB YOU WN  I DON'T W THEY HEIS RI E OTOF ISESS IS IN TO THE THE GRA BY AT THE THI  HIS OR O  IS TIS TINS ANA D THIN THAT WE MEAN TO STER R AR OER LAKEN THISNESS JUNIFER YET THINGS FAC THEY WAS TAN UNEMEIN RITING OF CHEC IN BYNAN MENASTERATION AND THEY HASN'T BEEN A CHEC A CHECK ON THE CHECK AND ALSO BOTH OF THOSE WOMEN INITIALLY SAID THEY WOULD VOTE FOR BIDEN BUT WHEN YOU ASK THEM WHO THETRUSSMARE ON THE ECONOMY THEY SAY DONALD TRUMP GOOD REMINDER VOTERS DON'T OPERATING STRAIGHT W THAT'S AD MIR YOU MADE A FACE AN IN WHIT WHAT WE LIT RY I TION I ALWAYS SAY THI HISTORICAL RULES ONLY WORK TILL THEY STOP WORK WH WE I THOUGHT WE KNEW ABOUT VOTING BEHAVIORS THTHAT THE PRESIDENTIAL APPROVALRATING TRACTS THE ECONOMY AND PRESIDENTIAL RAPPROVALRATING IS A PROXY FOR THE BALLAT FOR WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO GET IN THE ELECTION WELL DON' TRUMP HAW TO GO ECONOMY BEFORE COVAD AND HE WAS VERY UNPOPULAR NOW MAYBE PEOPLE DISAPPROVE OF BIDON AND WILL VOTE FOR HIM ANY WAY THIS IS THIS IS ALL VERY CONFUSE IT IS CONFUSING AND IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THAT TRUMP AMNESIA THAT THE MIND CAMPINT IS OFTEN TALKING I OUTRIGHT NOW WHERE THER REALAY OUT HER TRING OR A MINE VOTERS LAY DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE  DO YOU REMEMBER THE PAND TAT MAKE YOU REMEMBER HOW UNSTABLE THINGS WARE ANS OF THAT S INTERESTING TO HEAR THAT FROM THESE FOLKS AND AND WHAT THIS TELLS US ABOUT THIS ELECTION IS THAT BECAUSE BOTH OF THESE GUISES AR SO UNPOPULAR AND NEGATIVE PARTIZAN SHIP MEANING YOU GO ON TO THE VOTING BOOTHS TO STOP SOMEONE NOT NAS SERLY BECAUSE YOUR THRILLED ABOUT THE GYT YOUR VOTING FOR IS IS THE BIGGEST MOTOF AITER OF VOTER BEHAVIOUR THIS IS GOING TO BE AND ELECTION THAT'S BASED AROUND CONVINCING VOTERS THAT THAT THE OTHER GUI WOULD ISN'N EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THE UNITED STATE AND I BELIEVE ALL TWELVE OF THEM WERE ASKED YOU CONSIDER YOUR VOTE MORE FOR SOME ONE OR GAINST THE OTHER PERSON AND I THINK ALL THEY WELL SEID AGAINS WHOW NO THAT'S SO TELLING BECAUSE I THINK THE THING I OFTEN HERE FROM VOTERS ON THE ROT IS I I WANT NOT TO VOTE AGAINST SOME ONE THAT'S WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DO WANT AT THE END OFTHE DAYS TO FEEL LIKE THEIR VOTING FOR SOMETHING BUT IN RALLY THAT'S NOT THE THE WAY THIS ELECTION IS IS SETTING OUT SO LET'S GO TO A DIFFERENT ASSUE ANDOTHER VERY TOPAN SERIN A FOR A LOT OF FOLKS THIS YEAR IS EMIGRATION TOT OFTEN COMES UP AS A VERY WEAK ISSUE FOR PRESIDENT BYTIN WHAT DID YOU HEAR FROM THE FOLKS IN THE REMON THISONE HE KNOW IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE ON THIS THERE IS IN SOME WAYS CAN SENSUS ALL TWELVE OF THESE FOLKS BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ON EMIGRATION AND TOUGHER EMIGRATION LAWS AGAIN AN ISSUE THAT I THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS AN ADVANTAGE EVEN WITH PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY DON'T WANT TO OR WILL NOT VOTE FOR HIM HE GIVES THE IMPRESSION OF JUST BEING TOUGHER AN STRUCTUR ON EMIGRATION BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE BIG HEAD SCRATCHERS THAT MAR AND I TALKED ABOUT AFTER THIS AND RICH OTSOM DO YOU WANT TO SEE ALL OF THE UN DOCUMENTED EMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY TO PORTED WHY SOWOF THINGERS WHO SUPPORTS TRUMPS PLANS TO DE PORT MILLIONS OF UNDOCUMENT AN IMIGRANTS IF HE'S REAL LECTED  A KIMBERLY  WHY NEEDA OR YESES SO WHY NEED H HOW'S A CAN A WORK I'M NT SURE WER ITS A GOOD THEORYET I DON'T SEE IT WORKI WA ACT YOUON POPER THAT WE GOU NEED TO STOP THE LEGALS FROM COMING IN TERE IS A LEGAL WAY TO COMTHROUGH THE OU ES YES I I I GET THE OUTRIS NOT WHAT OU FOR COMING IN HA YOU DOPORT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIVING IN THE OU ESS  SCRAT FOR ME WHAT YOUN IF YOU SUPPORTED HOW YOU EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN I'M NOT SURE BECAUS I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT HAPPEN TO GET RID OF SOMEOR THE ONE AT AR YOUR ELEGALLY OR GIVE THEM UP HALF RIGHT NOW THAT THEY COULD BECOME AMERICANINS LEGALLY AND STOP MORECOMING AIN I GO AWAY HOLLASIN AT'S I IT'SO THIT TIS A HUGE DIFFERS IT'S ME PA DEVILS AVICCAN AN TO SAY IS TE USE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GIVING THEM A HAT THISIS INCE YIP AND TEPORTING IT IS  A REALLY COMPLICATED CONFUSING ISSUE EVEND BUT THE PEOPLE FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT IT BUT THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE POLICY IS THAT THEY WANT BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT'S ONE OF MY TAKE AWAYS FROM THIS WAS IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE BIG FIGHT ON CAPITAL HILL EARLIER THIS YEAR WHERE THEY TRIED TO GET A BIG BY PARTISAN EMIGRATION BILL TO JO BIDON AND IT CAME OUT OF THE SENETE AND IT WAS DERAILED IN THE HOUSE BY SPEAKER JOHNSON AND SPECIFICALLY DONALD TRUMP HOLD ER PUBLICANS DO NOT VOTE FOR THIS I THINK IF JO BIDON WOULD HAVE BEEN HANDED A BIG EMIGRATION VICTORY IN THE SELECTION THAT COULD HAVE BEEN REALLY BAD FOR DONALD TRUMPS CAMPAIGN AND THE POLITICS OF THAT LISTENING TO THESE VOTERS SEEM VERY LADE BARE TO ME AND AND WHEN WHEN SHE SAYS GIVING A BIG WIND TO JOBINE NOT SOME BIG POLITICAL WHEN THAT HE COULD SPIN AND ACTUAL WHEN IT WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY DECREASED TO LEGAL EMIGRATION AT THE BORDER AND THAT'S WHAT DONAL TRUMP WAS AGAINST BECAUSE HE NEEDS PEOPLE TO BE ANGRY ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE BORDER NOW I'M ANOTHER ISSUE THA I WANTED TO BRING OUP OF COURSE IS A BORTION THESE FOLKS THAT YOU REST OUT TO THE DOESN' PEOPLE THEY TEN TO BE MORE IN APAN ET LIKE YOU THAT RIGHT IM MORE LIKELY TO SUPPORT A WORHON WRIHTES THAT'S WHERE PUBLIC OPINION REALLY LANDS IT SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD THEN BE A BOOST FOR DERCAT'S FOR JOBIDEN IF THAT'S THEYRE BELIEVE SPET IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT YOU HARD I MIN LIKE WE SAIT PEOPLE AREN'T ENTIRELY VOTING IN A STRAIHT LINE HERE SURE I MEAN ALL TWELVE ESSENTIALLY CONSIDER THEMSELVES PRO CHOICE  WHEN ASK THAT QUESTION TWO OF THE TWELVE SAID THEY SUPPORTED THE SUPREME PORT DECISION TO OVER TURN ROVERSES WADE BUT THEY DIDDED IN SORT OF A LEGALISTIC WAY THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A BAD LEGAL PROCITON THAT THAT THE THE LAW WAS BETTER TO T E HANDED BACK TO THE STATES BUT WHEN PUSH TO SAY LIKE BUT WAIT DO YOU THINK WOMEN SHOULD HAVE TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF YOUR STATE TO GET ABORTION SERVICES THEY WERE LIKE OH NO LIKE I DON'T WANT ANY ONE TO BE HURD LIKE ON ON THE POLICY OF ABORTION THEY WOULD CONSIDER THEMSELVES PORCHOICE BUT THIS IS ANOTHER INTERESTING POINT BECAUSE IN THE SECOND FOCUS GROUP WANTOF THE WOMEN SAID SHE WAS GON A PLAND TOVOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP BUT THEN ALSO SAID SHE CONSIDERED HERSELF PROCHOICE I SHOW FINGERS FOR HOW MANY OF YOU WILL ABORTION BE A BIG FACTOR IN WHO VOT FOR IN NOVEMBERS PRESIDENT YUA LECTION BOR YOU BE BIG FACTOR WE SH HOWS GAN DI TI FACTOR FOR YOU BECAUSE I DON'T THANK STATES SHOULD DECIDE THAT I TANK IT SHOULD B UP TO THE WOMEN C SO HEW ME WIT THIS YOU SAID YOU R EN EVOTE FOR TRUM I THE TWO WA RASE POM IS MUST GIVE BACK TO THE STATES HOW IS THAT THAN TO YOUR CACU A WELL I WULD SAY LUK AT AL WHY HE SOMEWORET FIRSAS SO I ASK IT WHEN NECESSARILY MAKE M IGOLA CROWN F H YOU KNOW THERE'S BEOR FACTORS THAT I LOK AT AND THAT SITURATION CA SA MATTNERS BATOUT THE THINGS MANIMAL Y A THAT IS A REALLY REALLY K THING O KA YONG PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THE WAR AND GASA IS THAT THEIR TOP ISSUE PUL SAY NO HERE THIS WOMAN IS PRO CHOICE BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY GAN TO BE THE DRIVING FACTOR IN HER DECISIONS SO THIS IS WHY PEOPLE DO FOCUST GROUPS BECAUSE THEY GIVE YOU A LITTLE KIND OF BEHIND THE PULLING SCENES YES  I MEA A LITERLY LIKE WE WERE JUST SAYING WHEN THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SUPPORT THE RIGHT FOR A WOMAN YE I I THAT SEME OF ORSAND THE MIGHT S  OM EXCEPTIONS THE RESTRICTIONS BUT THEN IT'S NOT LIKE THT NEST THERALLY MEANS O CABLE THEN EXWISY PRESENT OF PEOPLE I RUNNING FOR DOBINE A DEMOCRATS ALTHOUGH LIKE THE EVIDENCE SINCE THE SUPREME COURSTO DECISION DOES SUGGEST THAT THAT ISSUE WHEN PUT DEVOTERS CLEARLY BENDS IN THE FAVOR OF DEMOCRATS BUT THIS ISNAN A BLANKET RULE RITES THAT THET LEARN COMLA I'LL ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO VOTED TO KEEP THE RIGHT TO ABORTION IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION IN CANSAS ARE NOT GOING TO TURN AROUND AND WORK VOTE FOR DEMOCRAT TRUP ANDOTHER WORDS THERE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WHO ARE STILL GIN A VOTE FOR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES BUT GIVEN A REFERAND AMON ABORTION THE'LL VOTE FOR THE THE ABORTION RIGHT SIDE PEOPLE ARE COMPLICATED THAT IS THE MAJOR TAKE AWAY ONE OTHER ISSUE THAT I WANTED TO TOUCH ON BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I HEAR THITS A LOT FROM FOLKS WHEN I GOT T ON THE ROAD THE SATE OF DEMOCRACY Y THIS IS SOME THING THAT THE BINE CAN VAN CERTAINLY IS TILKING ABOUT ALL THE TIME THEY LITRALLY JUST HAP LIKE THA AM POLICE OFFICERS FROM JANUARY SEX ARE ON LIKE A A NATION WHY TO WORK GOINING ABOUT I GOINT AIRS OWHEN I TRYING TO TALK ABOUT YOU NON'T PROTECTING DEMOCRACY HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS ON PEOPLE'S MINDS IN THIS FOGSCRIPT AN IMPORTANT FACT TO HERE AND AND I MADE SUREOF RICH ASK THESE VOTERS THIS IF THEY BELIEVE THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION WAS DECIDED FAIRLY AND ALL TWELVE SAID THEY DID SO THERE'S NO DISPUTE ON THAT OUTCOME SHO JUST CONTO GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WHERE THEIR COMING FROM ONE THING THAT WAS REALLY STRIKING TO ME ESPECIALLY CAUSE A SUPERMAJORITY OF THESE VOTERS CONSIDER THEMSELVES POLITICAL INDE PENENTS GANUARY SIXTH REALLY DOESN'T RESINATE WITH THEM IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT ANY OF THEM BROAD O INDEPENDENTLY WHEN ASKED ABOUT TRUMP OR ANY OF SORT OF DEMOCRACY BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY WERE ASKED HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE STATE OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND THE ANSWER IS NOT GOOD YOU BE A WORD OR PHRASE DON'T BLORDED OW TO IS TO DESCRIE THE CURRENT STATE OF THE MERICAN DEMOCRACY A RES OLISIA AM GOIN DOWN HEL WOTAN EO  STRA FACTO WE NEDA ER WON THIY I WANT TO ASK THOUG IS A LOWTEMES FOR FOLKS ON DEMOCRATS ON ON PUBLICAN SIDE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT SENSE OF WHAT A SAFE DEMOCRACY MEANS OR A HEALTHY DEMOCRACY MEANS RIGHT LIKE A LOT OF LIBERALS AR OU KNON'T ONCE TO POINT I JANEARY SEX ON ME LIKE I'M WORID ABOUT A PEACEFUL TRANSE FOR POWER YOU HAVE SOME REPUBLICENDS THERE AIN TO BEU LIKE WOLL THEIR'S ELECTION FROTS RAMPA BUT THIS IS WHY I ASKD THE TWENTY TWENTY QUESTION RIGHT CAUSE I THINK THAT THAT IS A GOOD TESS POINT TO SAY DO YOU BELIEVE THE ELECTION WAS DECIDED FAIRLY BECAUSE A LOT OF THE RESPONSE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE WHEN YOU PRESS ON THAT IF THEY DON'T BELIEVE THE DELECTION WAS DECIDED FAIRLY IS OF COURSE YOU THINK DEMOCRACYAT RISTS IS THAT RISK IF YOU THINK AN ELECTION WAS STOLEN FROM YOUR CANDIDATE SO THESE PEOPLE ARE ON THE LEVEL THEY'D SEE THAT THE ELECTION WAS FAIR THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS FRAUD BUT THERE IS AN I THINK ALL OF THE SPEAKS LIKE TO MARS POINT ABOUT NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING AN NEGATIVE PARTISAN SHIP BUT JUST GENERALLY SPEAKING I THINK THAT AMERICANS AND THESE VOTERS IN PARTICULAR FEEL SUPERNEGATIVE ABOUT THE STATE OF THEIR COUNTRY'S HEALTH AN TERMS OF THE ECONOMY AND ALSO SUPERNEGATIVE OF BOUT JUST THE STATE OF THE AMERICAN EXPERIMEN AND THAT SPEAKS TO JUST THE CLIMATE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION THAT IS UNION OR CAN LE E THERE FOR TO DAY I'ME KEEP A SHIVEROM I COVER TH WI HOUS I'MS WHOSN DAVE US TO COVERPOLITICS
